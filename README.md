## A Shiny App to visualize _Vaccination Campaign_ against SARS-CoV-2 in Italy
### Andrea Pio Cutrera - Matriculation Number: 965591

The app is reachable at: <https://andreacutrera.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/>

This is a _Shiny App_ that makes an easy visualization of the **Vaccination Campaign** against **SARS-CoV-2** in Italy started in `27-12-2020`.
The App scrapes data from the open repository of the **_Extraordinary Commissioner for Covid-19 Emergency of the Ministry Council_** (<https://github.com/italia/covid19-opendata-vaccini>), which makes a daily update of detailed data at regional level in order to report transparently the surveillance  for the contrast to Covid-19 (<https://www.governo.it/it/cscovid19>).

There are three sections accessible in the upper panel, and they are named (in order from the left to the right): `Age Ranges`, `Best Regions` and `Analysis`.

### Section 1 - Age Ranges

In this section in the upper left part of the page, there is a side bar panel from which you can select:
- the Region of interest (`19 Regions` and `2 Autonomous Provinces`)
- the particular Vaccine dose (`Pfizer/BionTech` - `VaxRevia-(AstraZeneca)` - `Moderna`)
- the variable of interest (absolute numbers of `Males`, `Females`, `First Doses`, `Second Doses`)

The output plot shows the absolute numbers of vaccine doses submitted in the last day of update (update occurs usually at 05:00 p.m. CEST) in 9 age groups from `16` to `90+`, since the `eligible people to the vaccine` are the subset of population older than 16 (`50,773,718` individuals).

### Section 2 - Best Regions

In this section you can select from a slider the number of `best-scoring Regions` in doses usage; an ordered bar chart (descending) in output describes the percentages of doses used on patients as a share of the total doses received by the central Government. So the value of the bar is a percentage.

### Section 3 - Analysis

In this section you can visualize an interactive `pie chart` in which you can select:
- the Region of interest (`19 Regions` and `2 Autonomous Provinces`)
- the particular Vaccine dose (`Pfizer/BionTech` - `VaxRevia-(AstraZeneca)` - `Moderna`)
- the age ranges (9 classes from `16` to `90+`)

Percentages of doses, split between `Men` and `Women`, are plotted in a pie chart.
